 Unit 3:

 #OOP Phrase Hunter Game

 This was a TreeHouse Tech Degree Project that is terminal/console based.

 The user will be provided a random phrase at the beginning of the game. At the
 beginning of the game the user will be provided with the phrase shown with
 empty underscores. The user will get to guess 1 letter out of the alphabet on
 each turn. If the letter is in the phrase that letter will appear in the phrase
 along with any others of it's equal in the phrase. If the letter does not exist the 
 user will be told that it was not in the phrase. The phrase will be updated with the 
 letter shown in the phrase with the remaining phrase still showing empty underscores.
 After every guess that is incorrect the guesses missed will decrease by 1 less life.
 The user will have a total of 5 missed guesses before they lose the game. The user
 will be prompted of the lives remaining after each missed guess. Once the user
 either wins or loses they will be prompted with a message depending on the outcome 
 and asked if they would like to play again.

 Have fun with this one! I hope you enjoy it!
